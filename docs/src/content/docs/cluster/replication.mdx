:::note[Roadmap Feature]
Multi-node replication is planned for a future release.

## Replication Model

TensorDB's append-only architecture simplifies replication:

- **No conflict resolution needed**: Facts are immutable and identified by (key, commit_ts)
- **Simple synchronization**: Replicate the WAL log entries
- **Temporal consistency**: commit_ts ordering is preserved across replicas

## Planned Features

### Synchronous Replication

Writes are committed only after replication to a majority of nodes:

```
Client → Leader → Replicate to Followers → Majority ACK → Commit → Response
```

### Asynchronous Replication

For lower-latency writes with eventual consistency:

```
Client → Leader → Commit → Response (async replicate to followers)
```

### Read Replicas

Dedicated read replicas for scaling read-heavy workloads:
- Receive streamed WAL updates from the leader
- Serve read queries with bounded staleness
- No write capability

## SSTable-Level Replication

Because SSTables are immutable, they can be replicated at the file level:
- New SSTables are transmitted to followers after compaction
- Followers apply the same manifest updates
- No need to replay individual writes
