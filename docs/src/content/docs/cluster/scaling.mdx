description: Horizontal and vertical scaling strategies for TensorDB.

:::note[Roadmap Feature]
Cluster scaling is planned for a future release. Current TensorDB is single-node.

## Current: Vertical Scaling

TensorDB scales vertically through:

- **More shards**: Increase `shard_count` for more write parallelism
- **More memory**: Larger caches and memtables reduce I/O
- **Faster storage**: NVMe SSDs minimize read latency
- **More cores**: Each shard can use its own core

## Planned: Horizontal Scaling

### Shard Distribution

Distribute shards across multiple nodes:

```
Node 1: Shards 0-3
Node 2: Shards 4-7
Node 3: Shards 8-11
```

### Resharding

When adding nodes, shards can be migrated:

1. Create new shards on the new node
2. Stream data from source shards
3. Atomically switch routing
4. Clean up source shards

### Cross-Node Queries

SQL queries that span multiple shards will be distributed:

```
Client → Coordinator → Fan-out to shard nodes → Merge results → Response
```

## Performance Expectations

| Configuration | Point Read | Point Write | Throughput |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| 1 node, 4 shards | 276ns | 1.9µs | ~500K writes/s |
| 3 nodes, 12 shards | ~500ns | ~3µs | ~1.5M writes/s |
| 5 nodes, 20 shards | ~600ns | ~4µs | ~2.5M writes/s |
