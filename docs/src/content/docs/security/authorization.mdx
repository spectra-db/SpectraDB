## Planned RBAC Model

### Roles

| Role | Permissions |
|------|------------|
| Admin | Full access — DDL, DML, configuration, AI features |
| ReadWrite | DML (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) + SELECT |
| ReadOnly | SELECT only |
| AIAdmin | AI feature configuration and insight access |

### Table-Level Permissions

```sql
-- Grant read access on specific tables
GRANT SELECT ON users TO role_readonly;

-- Grant write access
GRANT INSERT, UPDATE ON orders TO role_readwrite;

-- Revoke access
REVOKE ALL ON admin_logs FROM role_readwrite;
```

### Key Prefix Permissions

For the key-value API, permissions can be scoped to key prefixes:

```rust
// Only allow reads under "public/" prefix
config.auth_prefix_rules = vec![
    PrefixRule { prefix: "public/", role: Role::ReadOnly, allow: true },
    PrefixRule { prefix: "__ai/", role: Role::AIAdmin, allow: true },
];
```

## Audit Logging

All access attempts (successful and denied) are logged:
- Who accessed what (key or table)
- When (commit_ts)
- What operation (read, write, DDL)
- Result (allowed, denied)

SpectraDB's immutable ledger naturally provides an audit trail for all write operations.
