description: Authentication mechanisms for SpectraDB access control.
---

:::note[Roadmap Feature]
Authentication is planned for a future release. Current SpectraDB is an embedded database with no built-in authentication layer.
:::

## Current State

As an embedded database, SpectraDB runs within your application process. Access control is managed at the application level.

## Planned Authentication

### API Key Authentication

```rust
let config = Config::default();
config.auth_enabled = true;
config.auth_api_keys = vec![
    ApiKey { key: "sk_prod_...", role: Role::Admin },
    ApiKey { key: "sk_read_...", role: Role::ReadOnly },
];
let db = Database::open("data", config)?;
```

### Token-Based Authentication

For network-accessible deployments:
- JWT token validation
- Token expiration and refresh
- Scope-based permissions

## Security Best Practices (Current)

Even without built-in authentication:

- **File permissions**: Restrict access to the data directory
- **Encryption at rest**: Use filesystem-level encryption (LUKS, FileVault)
- **Network isolation**: Don't expose the database directory over the network
- **Application-level auth**: Validate users in your application before database calls
