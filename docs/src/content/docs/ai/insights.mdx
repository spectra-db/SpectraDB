description: Automatic pattern synthesis from write streams in TensorDB.
---

When `ai_auto_insights` is enabled, TensorDB's AI runtime analyzes write patterns and generates insights automatically.

## How It Works

1. **Event collection**: Writes are batched into event windows
2. **Batch processing**: When the batch window expires or reaches max events, the batch is processed
3. **Insight synthesis**: Patterns are detected and insights are generated
4. **Persistence**: Insights are stored as facts under `__ai/insight/...` keys

## Configuration

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `ai_auto_insights` | `false` | Enable insight synthesis |
| `ai_batch_window_ms` | `20` | Batch collection window |
| `ai_batch_max_events` | `16` | Max events per batch |

## Example Insights

The AI runtime can detect patterns like:

- **Write bursts**: Unusual spikes in write frequency
- **Key hotspots**: Keys receiving disproportionate write traffic
- **Schema drift**: Changes in value structure over time
- **Temporal anomalies**: Writes with unusual valid_from/valid_to patterns

## Accessing Insights

Insights are stored as immutable facts and can be queried:

```rust
let insights = db.scan_prefix("__ai/insight/")?;
for (key, value) in insights {
    println!("{}: {:?}", key, value);
}
```

## Isolation

Insights are invisible to user change feeds — subscribing to changes only returns user-written data, not AI-generated metadata.
