title: Full-Text Search
description: Built-in full-text search with tokenization and relevance scoring in SpectraDB.
---

SpectraDB includes a built-in full-text search (FTS) engine as a facet alongside the relational SQL surface.

## Creating an FTS Index

```rust
// Enable FTS on a key prefix
db.create_fts_index("articles/")?;
```

## Indexing Documents

```rust
db.put("articles/1", Value::Text(
    "SpectraDB is a bitemporal database with MVCC support".into()
))?;

db.put("articles/2", Value::Text(
    "The LSM storage engine uses bloom filters for fast lookups".into()
))?;
```

## Searching

```rust
let results = db.fts_search("articles/", "bitemporal MVCC")?;
for (key, score) in results {
    println!("{}: relevance={:.2}", key, score);
}
```

## Features

- **Tokenization**: Text is split into tokens for indexing
- **Relevance scoring**: TF-IDF based scoring ranks results by relevance
- **Prefix matching**: Search for partial words
- **Boolean queries**: AND, OR operators for combining terms

## Use Cases

- Document search within the database
- Log analysis and filtering
- Content-based retrieval alongside structured SQL queries
