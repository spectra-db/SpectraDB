description: Bucketed time-series metrics and aggregation in TensorDB.
---

TensorDB's time series facet provides efficient storage and querying of timestamped metric data.

## Storing Metrics

```rust
use tensordb::Value;

// Store a metric data point
db.put_temporal(
    "metrics/cpu/host-1",
    Value::Real(72.5),
    1718409600,  // valid_from: timestamp
    1718409660,  // valid_to: +60s (1-minute bucket)
)?;
```

## Bucketed Aggregation

Query metrics with time buckets:

```sql
-- Average CPU per 5-minute bucket
SELECT
    (valid_from / 300) * 300 as bucket,
    AVG(CAST(value AS REAL)) as avg_cpu
FROM __keys__
WHERE key LIKE 'metrics/cpu/%'
GROUP BY bucket
ORDER BY bucket;
```

## Use Cases

- **Infrastructure monitoring**: CPU, memory, disk usage over time
- **Application metrics**: Request latency, error rates, throughput
- **IoT data**: Sensor readings with temporal bucketing
- **Financial data**: Price history with business-time semantics

## Bitemporal Advantage

Unlike traditional time-series databases, TensorDB's bitemporal model lets you:

- **Backfill data**: Write historical metrics without disrupting the timeline
- **Correct errors**: Write a correction for past data while preserving the original
- **Audit changes**: See what metrics were known at any point in system time
