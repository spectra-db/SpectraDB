# Changelog

All notable changes to TensorDB are documented in this file.

## [0.29] — EOAC Architecture: Transactions, PITR, Incremental Backup

### Added
- **Epoch-Ordered Append-Only Concurrency (EOAC)** — Global `AtomicU64` epoch counter unifying transactions, MVCC, recovery, and time travel
- `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK`/`SAVEPOINT` transactions with epoch-numbered commits
- `SELECT ... AS OF EPOCH <n>` for cross-shard point-in-time recovery
- `BACKUP TO '<path>' SINCE EPOCH <n>` for incremental backup (delta export since a given epoch)
- `BACKUP TO '<path>'` / `RESTORE FROM '<path>'` for full backup and restore
- `TXN_COMMIT` markers storing `max_commit_ts` for epoch→snapshot resolution
- Cross-shard epoch synchronization via `bump_commit_counter()` — ensures PITR correctness across shards
- `Database::advance_epoch()` API for manual epoch advancement
- `Database::current_epoch()` API for querying the current epoch
- **Encryption at rest** — AES-256-GCM block-level encryption for SSTable data and WAL frames (`--features encryption`)
- `EncryptionKey` with passphrase derivation (SHA-256) and key file support (32-byte raw or 64-char hex)
- WAL epoch tracking: `replay_until_epoch()`, `replay_epoch_range()`, `max_epoch()` methods
- 23 new integration tests in `tests/epoch_core.rs` covering transactions, PITR, and incremental backup

### Changed
- `advance_epoch()` now bumps all shard commit counters to the epoch value for cross-shard consistency
- Transaction `COMMIT` stores `max_commit_ts` (maximum across all writes) instead of `last_commit_ts`
- Query planner: `#[allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]` on multi-parameter join functions

## [0.2.0] — Embedded LLM: Natural Language → SQL

### Added
- Embedded Qwen3-0.6B model for natural language to SQL translation via llama.cpp
- `ASK '<question>'` SQL statement — translates NL to SQL and executes in one step
- `Database::ask()` and `Database::ask_sql()` Rust API methods
- `PyDatabase.ask()` Python binding returning `{"sql": ..., "result": ...}`
- `# <question>` prefix in both Rust and Python CLI shells (shows generated SQL, asks to confirm)
- `LlmEngine` with lazy model loading, greedy sampling, and output cleaning
- `llm` feature flag (default on) backed by `llama-cpp-2` crate
- `llm_model_path` and `llm_max_tokens` config fields
- `LlmNotAvailable` and `LlmError` error variants
- Schema-aware prompting: gathers table schemas via SHOW TABLES + DESCRIBE before translation

### Changed
- All crate versions bumped to 0.2.0

## [0.28] — Fast Write Engine

### Added
- Lock-free `FastWritePath` bypassing crossbeam channel (~1.9 µs writes, 20x faster than SQLite)
- Group-commit WAL via `DurabilityThread` — one fdatasync per batch cycle across all shards
- `fast_write_enabled` config (default: true) and `fast_write_wal_batch_interval_us` (default: 1000)
- Automatic fallback to channel path on memtable backpressure or subscriber activity
- `Database::sync()` for explicit durability flush
- Channel-path benchmark (`tensordb_point_write_channel`) for comparison

### Changed
- `ShardShared` fields now `pub(crate)` for direct access by fast write path
- `commit_counter` uses `AtomicU64` with `fetch_add` for lock-free timestamp assignment
- `has_subscribers` AtomicBool for fast-path/channel-path routing
- Shard actor syncs `local_commit_counter` from atomic before every write
